# Response: MarkdownTextEditor Toolbar Fix

## Reviewer Points & Actions
- **Race condition clearing `pendingAction`**  
  - `TextPageEditorAction` is `Equatable`, so compilation is safe.  
  - Resolution: keep SwiftUI intent binding but guard coordinator queue with lifecycle checks and deterministic teardown to prevent stale clears.

- **Dual action management concerns**  
  - Decision: retain current SwiftUI binding + coordinator queue because it prevents crash-causing re-entrancy. Additional safeguards (lifecycle guard, defer cleanup) will ensure both layers stay in sync.

- **Async recursion cleanup**  
  - Update `processNextToolbarAction` to use `defer` and `weak self`, guaranteeing `isProcessingToolbarAction` resets even if `apply` exits early.

- **Lifecycle safety**  
  - Add `textView.window != nil` guard before dequeuing/processing actions; drain the queue if the view disappears.

- **Thread assumptions**  
  - Document and assert main-thread usage in debug builds with `dispatchPrecondition`.

- **Queue visibility / size**  
  - Add debug log when queue depth exceeds a small threshold; no hard limit yet.

- **Testing gap**  
  - Add XCTest exercising multiple rapid toolbar actions to ensure queue drains and `pendingAction` clears without crashing.

- **Documentation**  
  - Add comment explaining why SwiftUI + coordinator layers coexist to prevent re-entrant updates.

## Outstanding Questions
- Need to confirm rapid toolbar UITest feasibility or fall back to unit-level coordinator exercise.
- Verify no retain cycle via async closures after changes (use Instruments if time allows).

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Implement coordinator safeguards (lifecycle guard, defer, debug precondition/logging).  
2. âœ… Add regression test under `YianaTests` for rapid toolbar action handling.  
3. ðŸ”„ Re-run simulator smoke test manually (document steps in PR).  
4. ðŸ”„ Update this response with test status and any follow-up items.

## Implementation Notes (2025-10-07)
- Added lifecycle guard, main-thread preconditions, and deferred cleanup in `MarkdownTextEditor.Coordinator` to keep queue + bindings in sync (`Yiana/Yiana/Views/MarkdownTextEditor.swift`).  
- Emitted debug logging when queue depth grows unexpectedly to aid crash triage in debug builds.  
- Documented coordinator role to clarify dual SwiftUI/Coordinator ownership.  
- Introduced `MarkdownTextEditorToolbarQueueTests` to simulate five rapid horizontal-rule insertions; verifies queue drains and caret tracking without crashes (`Yiana/YianaTests/MarkdownTextEditorToolbarQueueTests.swift`).  
- Pending: manual simulator validation & PR notes once reviewer satisfied.
