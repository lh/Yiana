**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Branch:** ocr-tuning
**Purpose:** Understand the current OCR implementation before tuning

---

## Executive Summary

YianaOCRService uses **Apple's Vision framework** (`VNRecognizeTextRequest`) as its underlying OCR engine. It's a Swift command-line service that watches the iCloud documents folder, processes `.yianazip` files, and outputs structured OCR results.

**Key Characteristics:**
- ✅ Native Apple technology (no third-party dependencies)
- ✅ Runs on Mac mini (devon) as background service
- ✅ High-resolution rendering (3x scale) for better accuracy
- ✅ Supports both fast and accurate recognition levels
- ⚠️ Currently set to "accurate" mode with language correction enabled

---

## OCR Engine: Apple Vision Framework

### Core Technology
```swift
// OCRProcessor.swift:104-108
let request = VNRecognizeTextRequest()
request.recognitionLevel = .accurate // or .fast
request.recognitionLanguages = ["en-US"]
request.usesLanguageCorrection = true
```

**Engine:** Apple's on-device Vision framework
- Part of macOS/iOS since iOS 13 / macOS 10.15
- Uses Apple's proprietary neural network models
- No network connectivity required
- Hardware-accelerated on Apple Silicon

### Recognition Levels

**Two modes available:**

1. **`.accurate`** (currently used)
   - Higher quality recognition
   - Slower processing
   - Better for complex documents
   - Uses larger neural network models

2. **`.fast`**
   - Lower quality recognition
   - Faster processing
   - Good for simple, clean documents
   - Uses smaller neural network models

**Current setting:** Line 104 shows we use `.accurate` by default

### Processing Pipeline

```
PDF Page → High-res Image → Vision Request → Text Observations → Structured Data
```

**Detailed flow:**

1. **PDF to Image Conversion** (`renderPageToImage`)
   - Scale: **3.0x** (line 147: `let scale: CGFloat = 3.0`)
   - For a standard letter page (612x792 pts): renders at 1836x2376 pixels
   - Uses RGB color space with white background
   - High resolution improves OCR accuracy

2. **Vision Processing** (`processPage`)
   - Creates `VNRecognizeTextRequest` with settings
   - Processes the high-resolution CGImage
   - Returns `VNRecognizedTextObservation` array

3. **Observation to Model Conversion** (`convertObservations`)
   - Extracts text, confidence, bounding boxes
   - Organizes into hierarchical structure: Blocks → Lines → Words
   - Normalizes coordinates to 0-1 range

4. **Output Generation**
   - JSON: Full structured data with metadata
   - XML: Alternative structured format
   - hOCR: HTML-based OCR format for interoperability

---

## Current Configuration

### Processing Options (from code)

```swift
// Default options in ProcessingOptions.swift
static let `default` = ProcessingOptions(
    recognitionLevel: .accurate,      // High quality
    languages: ["en-US"],              // English only
    useLanguageCorrection: true,       // Enable autocorrect
    extractFormData: false,            // Skip form extraction
    extractDemographics: false,        // Skip demographics
    customDataHints: nil               // No custom hints
)
```

### Deployment Configuration (devon)

From `com.vitygas.yiana-ocr.plist`:
```xml
<string>watch</string>
<string>--path</string>
<string>/Users/devon/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~vitygas~Yiana/Documents</string>
```

**Service behavior:**
- Watches iCloud Documents folder
- Processes files with `ocrCompleted: false`
- Writes results to `.ocr_results/` subdirectory
- Tracks processed files to avoid reprocessing

## Performance Characteristics

### Speed vs. Quality Trade-offs

**Current (.accurate mode):**
- ✅ **Pros:**
  - Best text recognition quality
  - Better handling of poor-quality scans
  - Improved language correction
  - More accurate bounding boxes

- ❌ **Cons:**
  - Slower processing (2-3x slower than fast mode)
  - Higher CPU/memory usage
  - Longer battery impact on laptops

**Alternative (.fast mode):**
- ✅ **Pros:**
  - 2-3x faster processing
  - Lower resource usage
  - Good for high-quality scans

- ❌ **Cons:**
  - Lower accuracy on complex documents
  - More errors on poor-quality scans
  - Less reliable bounding boxes

### Image Resolution Impact

**Current: 3.0x scale** (line 147)
- Standard letter page: ~1.8 megapixels
- Trade-off: Higher resolution = better OCR but slower rendering

**Potential tuning:**
- 2.0x scale: 4x faster rendering, slight accuracy loss
- 4.0x scale: 4x slower rendering, minimal accuracy gain
- Optimal: Depends on scan quality

---

## Language Support

### Current Implementation
```swift
request.recognitionLanguages = ["en-US"]
request.usesLanguageCorrection = true
```

**Limited to English (US)** only

### Vision Framework Capabilities

Apple Vision supports **multiple languages:**
- English (various regions)
- Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese
- Chinese (Simplified & Traditional)
- Japanese, Korean
- Many others

**Language correction:**
- Uses iOS/macOS dictionaries
- Corrects common OCR mistakes
- Context-aware word suggestions
- Currently enabled

---

## Data Extraction Features

### Form Field Detection (Currently Disabled)

**Simple heuristic approach** (line 256-283):
```swift
// Looks for "Label: Value" patterns
if text.contains(":") {
    let components = text.components(separatedBy: ":")
    // Extract label and value
}
```

**Field type detection:**
- Email (contains @ and .)
- Phone (matches XXX-XXX-XXXX pattern)
- Date (matches MM/DD/YYYY pattern)
- Number (parseable as Double)
- Text (default)

**Limitation:** Very basic pattern matching, no machine learning

### Demographics Extraction (Currently Disabled)

**Pattern-based extraction** (line 335-365):
- First/Last name
- Date of birth
- Gender
- Phone, Email
- Address (street, city, state, zip)
- Medical record number
- Insurance ID

**Approach:** Keyword matching on field labels
- Example: "first name", "fname" → firstName
- Example: "dob", "date of birth" → dateOfBirth

**Limitation:** Requires structured forms with clear labels

### Entity Recognition (Currently Disabled)

**Regex-based extraction** (line 395-445):
- Dates: `\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{2,4}`
- Phone: `\(?\d{3}\)?[-.\\s]?\d{3}[-.\\s]?\d{4}`
- Email: `[A-Z0-9a-z._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}`

**Limitation:** No NLP or machine learning; just regex patterns

---

## Integration with Yiana App

### Output Format

**Primary:** JSON files in `.ocr_results/`
```json
{
  "pages": [
    {
      "pageNumber": 1,
      "text": "Full text of page",
      "textBlocks": [...],
      "confidence": 0.95
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.93,
  "metadata": {
    "processingTime": 2.5,
    "pageCount": 3
  }
}
```

### Search Integration

From the iOS app's search system:
1. OCR service writes JSON to `.ocr_results/`
2. BackgroundIndexer reads OCR JSON
3. Indexes full text into SQLite FTS5
4. App performs fast full-text search

**Page numbering:** Consistently 1-based throughout

### Text Layer Embedding (Disabled)

```swift
// Line 454-464: Currently disabled
public func embedTextLayer(in pdfData: Data, with ocrResult: OCRResult) throws -> Data {
    // Temporarily disabled - was causing text selection issues
    return pdfData // Returns unmodified PDF
}
```

**Rationale:** Widget annotations interfered with native PDF text selection

---

## Strengths of Current Approach

1. **Native Integration**
   - No external dependencies
   - Leverages Apple's ML models
   - Hardware-accelerated on Apple Silicon
   - Privacy-focused (on-device)

2. **Good Architecture**
   - Clean separation: Processor → Exporter → Watcher
   - Multiple output formats (JSON, XML, hOCR)
   - Structured data model (blocks → lines → words)
   - Proper error handling

3. **Production-Ready**
   - Runs as launchd service
   - Health monitoring (heartbeat files)
   - Tracks processed documents
   - Watchdog script for alerting

4. **Flexible**
   - Configurable recognition level
   - Adjustable image scale
   - Language selection support
   - Custom paths for testing

## Weaknesses / Tuning Opportunities

### 1. Fixed "Accurate" Mode
**Issue:** Always uses slow, high-quality mode
**Impact:** Slower processing, higher resource usage
**Tuning opportunity:**
- Adaptive mode selection based on document quality
- Fast mode for clean scans, accurate for poor quality
- Could reduce processing time by 50%+ for good scans

### 2. Fixed 3.0x Image Scale
**Issue:** One-size-fits-all rendering resolution
**Impact:** May be overkill for high-DPI scans, insufficient for low-DPI
**Tuning opportunity:**
- Detect source PDF resolution
- Adjust scale: 2.0x for 300+ DPI scans, 4.0x for <150 DPI
- Potential 30-40% speed improvement for modern scans

### 3. English-Only Language
**Issue:** Hard-coded to "en-US"
**Impact:** Poor results for non-English documents
**Tuning opportunity:**
- Auto-detect language from metadata or content
- Support multi-language documents
- Let users specify language preference

### 4. Disabled Language Correction
**Wait, no!** Actually enabled (line 108: `usesLanguageCorrection = true`)
**This is good** - but could be made configurable

### 5. Basic Form/Entity Extraction
**Issue:** Regex-only, no ML
**Impact:** Low accuracy, misses complex patterns
**Tuning opportunity:**
- Use NaturalLanguage framework for better entity extraction
- Train custom models for medical/legal forms
- Not critical for general use case

### 6. No Text Layer in PDF
**Issue:** OCR results stored separately, not in PDF
**Impact:** Third-party PDF apps can't search OCR text
**Consideration:**
- Was causing issues with selection
- Could revisit with invisible text approach
- Low priority if search works in-app

### 7. No Progress Reporting
**Issue:** Service doesn't expose processing progress
**Impact:** Users don't know if OCR is working or how long it'll take
**Tuning opportunity:**
- Emit progress notifications
- Update document metadata with processing status
- Show progress in iOS app

---

## Tuning Recommendations (Priority Order)

### High Priority (Big Impact, Low Risk)

**1. Adaptive Recognition Level**
```swift
// Detect document quality first
let quality = assessScanQuality(image)
request.recognitionLevel = quality > 0.8 ? .fast : .accurate
```
**Expected gain:** 40-60% faster for clean documents

**2. Dynamic Image Scaling**
```swift
// Check source PDF DPI
let sourceDPI = estimatePDFDPI(page)
let scale = sourceDPI < 150 ? 4.0 :
            sourceDPI < 250 ? 3.0 : 2.0
```
**Expected gain:** 25-35% faster for high-DPI documents

**3. Progress Reporting**
```swift
// Emit progress during processing
NotificationCenter.default.post(
    name: .yianaOCRProgress,
    object: ["progress": 0.5, "page": 3, "total": 6]
)
```
**Expected gain:** Better UX, no performance impact

### Medium Priority (Good Impact, More Work)

**4. Multi-Language Support**
- Auto-detect from document
- User preference in iOS app
- Pass to OCR service via metadata

**5. Batch Processing Optimization**
- Process multiple pages concurrently
- Use `.concurrent` dispatch queue more effectively
- Currently sequential (line 85-96)

**6. Better Error Recovery**
- Retry failed pages with different settings
- Fallback to fast mode if accurate times out
- Save partial results

### Low Priority (Nice-to-Have)

**7. Advanced Entity Extraction**
- Use NaturalLanguage framework
- Custom medical/legal entity recognizers
- Only valuable for specific use cases

**8. Text Layer Re-Implementation**
- Invisible text overlay without widgets
- Would enable third-party app search
- Low priority if in-app search works well

## Testing Strategy for Tuning

### Benchmark Suite

**Sample documents needed:**
1. High-quality scans (300+ DPI, clean text)
2. Medium-quality scans (150-250 DPI)
3. Low-quality scans (<150 DPI, noise, skew)
4. Born-digital PDFs (already have text)
5. Mixed documents (photos + text)

**Metrics to track:**
- Processing time per page
- OCR accuracy (character error rate)
- Confidence scores
- Memory usage
- CPU utilization

### A/B Testing Approach

```
Current (baseline):
- Mode: .accurate
- Scale: 3.0x
- Language: en-US
- Correction: enabled

Test variants:
A) Adaptive mode + fixed scale
B) Fixed mode + adaptive scale
C) Adaptive mode + adaptive scale (best of both)
D) Fast mode only (speed ceiling)
```

### Success Criteria

**Must maintain:**
- >95% accuracy on clean documents
- >90% accuracy on medium-quality documents
- >85% accuracy on poor-quality documents

**Target improvements:**
- 40%+ faster processing for clean documents
- 20%+ faster processing overall
- No accuracy regression on difficult documents
