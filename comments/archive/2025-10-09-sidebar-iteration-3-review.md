# Sidebar Iteration 3 Review Notes
**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Summary**
- Delete button should require confirmation (e.g., alert) because page removal is destructive.
- Consider icon-only for duplicate/delete actions due to limited space (implemented).
- Future actions to consider: copy/cut/paste, share, context menu.
