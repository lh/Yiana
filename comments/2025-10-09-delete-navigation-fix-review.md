# Delete Navigation Fix Review

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: ✅ Elegant Solution
**Issue**: Deleting pages before current page doesn't adjust navigation
**Solution**: Calculate shift and adjust index before bounds check

---

## The Fix - Smart Index Shift Calculation

### Before (Lines 750-758, old)

```swift
let maxIndex = self.currentDocumentPageCount(from: viewModel)
if currentViewedPage >= maxIndex {
    currentViewedPage = max(0, maxIndex - 1)
    navigateToPage = currentViewedPage
}
```

**Problem**: Only adjusted if current page was beyond new document bounds, didn't account for pages deleted *before* current position.

### After (Lines 750-759, new)

```swift
let maxIndex = self.currentDocumentPageCount(from: viewModel)
let shift = deletionIndices.filter { $0 < currentViewedPage }.count
if shift > 0 {
    currentViewedPage = max(0, currentViewedPage - shift)
}
if currentViewedPage >= maxIndex {
    currentViewedPage = max(0, maxIndex - 1)
}
navigateToPage = currentViewedPage
```

**Solution**: Two-step adjustment:
1. **Shift adjustment** - Move current page left by number of deleted pages before it
2. **Bounds check** - Clamp to valid range if still out of bounds

---

## How It Works

### Example Scenario 1: Delete Pages Before Current

**Initial state**:
- Document: [A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4, F=5, G=6, H=7, I=8, J=9] (10 pages)
- Viewing page H (index 7)

**User deletes pages B, C, D** (indices 1, 2, 3):

```swift
deletionIndices = [1, 2, 3]
currentViewedPage = 7

// Step 1: Calculate shift
shift = deletionIndices.filter { $0 < 7 }.count
// [1, 2, 3] are all < 7
shift = 3

// Step 2: Apply shift
if shift > 0 {
    currentViewedPage = max(0, 7 - 3)  // 4
}

// Step 3: Bounds check
maxIndex = 7  // 10 - 3 deleted = 7 pages
if 4 >= 7 {  // false
    // No further adjustment needed
}

navigateToPage = 4
```

**Result**:
- New document: [A=0, E=1, F=2, G=3, H=4, I=5, J=6]
- Still viewing H, now at index 4 ✅ Correct!

### Example Scenario 2: Delete Pages After Current

**Initial state**:
- Document: [A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4] (5 pages)
- Viewing page B (index 1)

**User deletes pages D, E** (indices 3, 4):

```swift
deletionIndices = [3, 4]
currentViewedPage = 1

// Step 1: Calculate shift
shift = deletionIndices.filter { $0 < 1 }.count
// No indices < 1
shift = 0

// Step 2: Apply shift
if shift > 0 {  // false
    // No adjustment
}

// Step 3: Bounds check
maxIndex = 3  // 5 - 2 deleted = 3 pages
if 1 >= 3 {  // false
    // No adjustment
}

navigateToPage = 1
```

**Result**:
- New document: [A=0, B=1, C=2]
- Still viewing B at index 1 ✅ Correct!

### Example Scenario 3: Delete Current Page and Pages After

**Initial state**:
- Document: [A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4] (5 pages)
- Viewing page D (index 3)

**User deletes pages D, E** (indices 3, 4):

```swift
deletionIndices = [3, 4]
currentViewedPage = 3

// Step 1: Calculate shift
shift = deletionIndices.filter { $0 < 3 }.count
// No indices < 3
shift = 0

// Step 2: Apply shift
if shift > 0 {  // false
    // No adjustment
}

// Step 3: Bounds check
maxIndex = 3  // 5 - 2 deleted = 3 pages
if 3 >= 3 {  // true - current page was deleted!
    currentViewedPage = max(0, 3 - 1)  // 2
}

navigateToPage = 2
```

**Result**:
- New document: [A=0, B=1, C=2]
- Now viewing C (index 2, the last page) ✅ Correct!

### Example Scenario 4: Delete Pages Before AND After Current

**Initial state**:
- Document: [A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4, F=5, G=6] (7 pages)
- Viewing page E (index 4)

**User deletes pages B, C, F, G** (indices 1, 2, 5, 6):

```swift
deletionIndices = [1, 2, 5, 6]
currentViewedPage = 4

// Step 1: Calculate shift
shift = deletionIndices.filter { $0 < 4 }.count
// [1, 2] are < 4
shift = 2

// Step 2: Apply shift
if shift > 0 {
    currentViewedPage = max(0, 4 - 2)  // 2
}

// Step 3: Bounds check
maxIndex = 3  // 7 - 4 deleted = 3 pages
if 2 >= 3 {  // false
    // No further adjustment
}

navigateToPage = 2
```

**Result**:
- New document: [A=0, D=1, E=2]
- Still viewing E, now at index 2 ✅ Correct!

### Example Scenario 5: Delete All Pages Before Current

**Initial state**:
- Document: [A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3] (4 pages)
- Viewing page D (index 3)

**User deletes pages A, B, C** (indices 0, 1, 2):

```swift
deletionIndices = [0, 1, 2]
currentViewedPage = 3

// Step 1: Calculate shift
shift = deletionIndices.filter { $0 < 3 }.count
// [0, 1, 2] are all < 3
shift = 3

// Step 2: Apply shift
if shift > 0 {
    currentViewedPage = max(0, 3 - 3)  // 0
}

// Step 3: Bounds check
maxIndex = 1  // 4 - 3 deleted = 1 page
if 0 >= 1 {  // false
    // No further adjustment
}

navigateToPage = 0
```

**Result**:
- New document: [D=0]
- Still viewing D, now at index 0 ✅ Correct!

## Code Quality Review

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Elegant calculation**:
   ```swift
   let shift = deletionIndices.filter { $0 < currentViewedPage }.count
   ```
   - Single line calculates how many pages before current were deleted
   - Clear intent, easy to understand
   - Efficient (single pass through deletion indices)

2. **Two-stage approach**:
   - Stage 1: Shift for deleted pages before current
   - Stage 2: Clamp if still out of bounds
   - Each stage handles a specific concern

3. **Order matters** (and it's correct):
   ```swift
   let shift = ...              // Calculate
   if shift > 0 { adjust }      // Apply shift first
   if currentViewedPage >= maxIndex { clamp }  // Then bounds check
   navigateToPage = currentViewedPage  // Finally update binding (outside conditions)
   ```
   - Shift adjustment BEFORE bounds check is correct
   - `navigateToPage` assignment moved outside (only set once at end)

4. **Edge case handling**:
   - `shift = 0` → No adjustment needed (pages deleted after current)
   - `shift > currentViewedPage` → `max(0, ...)` prevents negative index
   - Current page deleted → Bounds check catches it and clamps
   - All pages deleted → Would result in navigating to page 0 of 1-page document (or document becomes empty, which is its own edge case)

### ✅ Improvement Over Previous Code

**Before**:
```swift
if currentViewedPage >= maxIndex {
    currentViewedPage = max(0, maxIndex - 1)
    navigateToPage = currentViewedPage
}
```
- Only handled "current page beyond end" case
- Missed "pages deleted before current" case

**After**:
```swift
let shift = deletionIndices.filter { $0 < currentViewedPage }.count
if shift > 0 {
    currentViewedPage = max(0, currentViewedPage - shift)
}
if currentViewedPage >= maxIndex {
    currentViewedPage = max(0, maxIndex - 1)
}
navigateToPage = currentViewedPage
```
- Handles both "deleted before" and "deleted at/after" cases
- Single assignment to `navigateToPage` at end (cleaner)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Filter Operation

```swift
let shift = deletionIndices.filter { $0 < currentViewedPage }.count
```

**Complexity**: O(n) where n = number of deleted pages

**Is this acceptable?**
- ✅ Yes - deletion is user-initiated and infrequent
- ✅ Typical selection: 1-5 pages (rarely >20)
- ✅ Filter is fast even for 100+ pages
- ✅ Clarity is more important than micro-optimization here

**Alternative (not needed)**:
```swift
// Could use binary search if deletionIndices is sorted
let sortedIndices = deletionIndices.sorted()
let shift = sortedIndices.firstIndex(where: { $0 >= currentViewedPage }) ?? sortedIndices.count
```
- More complex, harder to read
- Marginal benefit (O(log n) vs O(n) for small n)
- Not worth it

## Edge Cases Analysis

### 1. Delete All Pages Except One

**Scenario**: 10 pages, viewing page 5, delete all except page 5

```swift
deletionIndices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]  // 9 deletions
currentViewedPage = 5

shift = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].count = 5
currentViewedPage = max(0, 5 - 5) = 0

maxIndex = 1  // Only 1 page left
if 0 >= 1 {  // false
}

navigateToPage = 0
```
✅ **Result**: Viewing the only remaining page (old page 5, now at index 0)

### 2. Delete Current Page Only

**Scenario**: 5 pages, viewing page 2, delete page 2

```swift
deletionIndices = [2]
currentViewedPage = 2

shift = [].count = 0  // No pages before current
currentViewedPage = 2  // No shift adjustment

maxIndex = 4
if 2 >= 4 {  // false
}

navigateToPage = 2
```

⚠️ **Potential issue**: Current page (2) was deleted, but we're still navigating to index 2

**However**: This is actually **okay** because:
- After deletion, old page 3 is now at index 2
- User sees next page after deleted one
- This is reasonable UX behavior

**Alternative consideration**: Should we check if current page was in deletion set?
```swift
if deletionIndices.contains(currentViewedPage) {
    // Navigate to page before deleted one?
    // Or first non-deleted page after?
}
```

**Current behavior is fine**: Navigating to same index (which now shows different content) is acceptable. Most deletion UIs do this.

### 3. Delete Last Page While Viewing It

**Scenario**: 5 pages, viewing page 4 (last page), delete page 4

```swift
deletionIndices = [4]
currentViewedPage = 4

shift = [].count = 0
currentViewedPage = 4

maxIndex = 4  // 5 - 1 = 4
if 4 >= 4 {  // true
    currentViewedPage = max(0, 4 - 1) = 3
}

navigateToPage = 3
```
✅ **Result**: Navigate to new last page (index 3)

### 4. Delete Everything (Edge Case)

**Scenario**: 3 pages, viewing page 1, delete all 3 pages

```swift
deletionIndices = [0, 1, 2]
currentViewedPage = 1

shift = [0].count = 1
currentViewedPage = max(0, 1 - 1) = 0

maxIndex = 0  // 3 - 3 = 0 (empty document!)
if 0 >= 0 {  // true
    currentViewedPage = max(0, 0 - 1) = 0  // max(0, -1) = 0
}

navigateToPage = 0
```

⚠️ **Potential issue**: Document is now empty (0 pages), but navigating to page 0

**Should we handle this?**
- Depends on DocumentViewModel.removePages behavior
- Does it allow removing all pages?
- What does PDFViewer show for empty document?

**Recommendation**: Check if this is possible:
- If app prevents deleting last page → No issue
- If app allows empty documents → PDFViewer should handle gracefully
- This code is correct (navigates to page 0, viewer decides what to show)

## Comparison: Delete vs Duplicate Navigation

### Delete Navigation (Current Fix)
```swift
let shift = deletionIndices.filter { $0 < currentViewedPage }.count
if shift > 0 {
    currentViewedPage = max(0, currentViewedPage - shift)
}
if currentViewedPage >= maxIndex {
    currentViewedPage = max(0, maxIndex - 1)
}
navigateToPage = currentViewedPage
```
**Philosophy**: Try to keep viewing "same content" (same page, adjusted for removals)

### Duplicate Navigation (Current Implementation)
```swift
if let target = indices.sorted().first.map({ min($0 + 1, currentDocumentPageCount(from: viewModel) - 1) }) {
    currentViewedPage = target
    navigateToPage = target
}
```
**Philosophy**: Show user the result of their action (navigate to duplicated page)

**Both approaches are sensible** for their respective operations.

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Test Cases

1. **Delete pages before current**
   - Start: 10 pages, viewing page 7
   - Delete: Pages 2, 3, 4
   - Expected: Still viewing old page 7 (now at index 4)

2. **Delete pages after current**
   - Start: 10 pages, viewing page 2
   - Delete: Pages 7, 8, 9
   - Expected: Still viewing page 2 at index 2

3. **Delete current page**
   - Start: 5 pages, viewing page 2
   - Delete: Page 2
   - Expected: Now viewing old page 3 (now at index 2)

4. **Delete current page + pages before**
   - Start: 7 pages, viewing page 5
   - Delete: Pages 1, 2, 5
   - Expected: Navigate to old page 6 (now at index 2)

5. **Delete last page while viewing it**
   - Start: 5 pages, viewing page 4
   - Delete: Page 4
   - Expected: Navigate to page 3 (new last page)

6. **Delete all but one page**
   - Start: 10 pages, viewing page 5
   - Delete: All except page 5
   - Expected: Viewing the remaining page at index 0

### Automated Test (If TDD)

```swift
func testDeleteNavigationAdjustment() {
    // Given: 10-page document, viewing page 7
    let viewModel = createTestDocument(pageCount: 10)
    var currentPage = 7

    // When: Delete pages 2, 3, 4 (indices 1, 2, 3)
    let deletionIndices = [1, 2, 3]
    let shift = deletionIndices.filter { $0 < currentPage }.count
    if shift > 0 {
        currentPage = max(0, currentPage - shift)
    }

    // Then: Current page should be 4 (old page 7, shifted left by 3)
    XCTAssertEqual(currentPage, 4)
}
```

## Summary

### What Was Fixed ✅

**Problem**: Deleting pages before current page didn't adjust navigation index
**Solution**: Calculate shift by counting deleted pages before current, apply adjustment
**Implementation**: 4 lines of code added/modified

### Why It's Excellent

1. **Mathematically correct**: Shift = count of deletions before current
2. **Edge case safe**: `max(0, ...)` prevents negative indices
3. **Readable**: Intent is clear from code structure
4. **Efficient**: O(n) where n = deletion count (typically <10)
5. **Comprehensive**: Handles all deletion scenarios (before/after/at current)

### Code Structure

```swift
// 1. Calculate how many pages before current were deleted
let shift = deletionIndices.filter { $0 < currentViewedPage }.count

// 2. Shift current page left by that amount
if shift > 0 {
    currentViewedPage = max(0, currentViewedPage - shift)
}

// 3. Clamp to valid range (if still out of bounds)
if currentViewedPage >= maxIndex {
    currentViewedPage = max(0, maxIndex - 1)
}

// 4. Apply navigation
navigateToPage = currentViewedPage
```

Clean, logical, correct. ✅

## Final Recommendation

✅ **Excellent fix - ready to commit**

**Suggested commit message**:
```
Fix delete navigation when removing pages before current page

Calculate shift based on number of deleted pages before current
position, then apply bounds check. Handles all edge cases:
- Pages deleted before current → shift index left
- Pages deleted after current → no shift needed
- Current page deleted → clamp to valid range

Also moves navigateToPage assignment outside conditionals for clarity.
```

**No further changes needed** - this implementation is solid! 🎉
