# App Store Readiness Review - Yiana Document Scanner

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Purpose**: Evaluate readiness for App Store release
**Context**: Niche app for managing many scanned PDFs with easy additions over time

---

## Core Value Proposition

### The Mission (User's Words)

> "For people who need to keep many scanned pdf files that are easily added to over time"

**Primary workflow**:
1. Open a file
2. Read the file
3. Add a scan in monochrome
4. Move to another file
5. Repeat

**Not competing with**: Notability, GoodNotes (too complex for this use case)

**Philosophy**: Simplicity over feature bloat

---

## Current Feature Assessment

### ✅ Core Features (Working)

#### Document Management
- ✅ **Create new documents** - UIDocument-based
- ✅ **Open existing documents** - Document list view
- ✅ **iCloud sync** - Automatic via iCloud container
- ✅ **Document metadata** - Title, dates, tags
- ✅ **Search** - Full-text search with OCR integration

#### PDF Viewing
- ✅ **Read PDFs** - PDFKit-based viewer
- ✅ **Page navigation** - Swipe, thumbnail sidebar (iPad)
- ✅ **Page overview** - Swipe-up sheet, sidebar thumbnails
- ✅ **Zoom and pan** - Standard PDF interactions

#### Scanning (The Core Workflow)
- ✅ **Color scans** - Via VisionKit document scanner
- ✅ **Monochrome scans** - B&W document mode
- ✅ **Append to existing** - Add pages to current document
- ✅ **Multiple pages** - Scan multiple at once
- ✅ **Good quality** - VisionKit perspective correction, etc.

#### OCR (Backend)
- ✅ **Mac mini service** - Watches for new documents
- ✅ **Automatic processing** - Processes PDFs in background
- ✅ **Search integration** - OCR text feeds search index
- ✅ **JSON/hOCR output** - Structured results

### ✅ Extras (Nice to Have, Working)

#### Markup
- ✅ **PencilKit integration** - Draw/annotate on pages
- ✅ **Per-page markup** - Edit individual pages

#### Markdown Text Pages
- ✅ **Text editor** - Create text pages within documents
- ✅ **Markdown rendering** - Converts to PDF pages
- ✅ **Draft system** - Provisional pages before committing

#### iPad Enhancements (This Week's Work)
- ✅ **Thumbnail sidebar** - Toggle on/off, left/right positioning
- ✅ **Page selection** - Select multiple pages
- ✅ **Delete pages** - With confirmation
- ✅ **Duplicate pages** - Copy pages within document

### ⚠️ Known Holes (User Identified)

#### 1. Copy Page Between Documents
**Current**: Can only duplicate within same document
**Needed**: Copy page from Document A to Document B

**Use case**:
- User has "Receipts 2024" and "Receipts 2025"
- Scan appears in wrong document
- Need to move it to correct document

**Complexity**: **MEDIUM**
**Implementation path**:
1. Select page(s) in source document
2. "Copy" action → Store in pasteboard or temp location
3. Open destination document
4. "Paste" action → Insert pages

**Alternative approach**: "Move to..." picker
```
Select page → "Move to..." → Shows document list → Choose destination → Page moves
```

#### 2. Page Reordering in Sidebar
**Current**: Reorder exists in swipe-up sheet (but has bug)
**Needed**: Reorder pages directly in sidebar

**Status**:
- Reorder logic exists (PageManagementView)
- Has critical bug (page content loss)
- Needs fix before enabling in sidebar

**Complexity**: **LOW** (once reorder bug is fixed)
**Implementation**: Add `.onMove()` modifier to sidebar thumbnail list

---

## Unknown Holes (Potential Issues)

### Critical Missing Features

#### 1. Document Export (Outside App Ecosystem)

**Current**:
- ✅ Can export single PDF via share sheet
- ❌ Can't export document with metadata
- ❌ Can't bulk export multiple documents

**Questions**:
- How does user get documents OFF the device if needed?
- If user stops using app, how do they recover their data?
- Can they open documents on computer without app?

**This relates to format issue** (see below)

#### 2. Document Organization Beyond Search

**Current**:
- ✅ Flat list of documents
- ✅ Search by title/content
- ✅ Tags (in metadata, not exposed in UI much)

**Missing**:
- ❌ Folders/collections
- ❌ Favorites/pinned documents
- ❌ Sort by date/title/size
- ❌ Filter by tag

**For "many scanned pdf files"**: Organization becomes critical

**User has many documents** → How do they find the right one quickly?

**Options**:
- Folders (like Files app)
- Tags + tag browser
- Smart folders (saved searches)
- Just rely on search (current approach)

**Assessment**:
- If document count < 20: Search is fine
- If document count > 50: Need better organization
- For target use case ("many files"): **Probably need folders**

**Complexity**: **MEDIUM-HIGH**
- Folders require directory structure
- iCloud sync with folders is complex
- Need UI for folder management

**Alternative**: **Tags are already in metadata**, just need UI
- Tag picker when editing document
- Filter by tag in document list
- Much simpler than folders

#### 3. Batch Operations

**Current**: Operate on one document at a time

**Use cases**:
- Tag 10 documents as "Receipts"
- Delete 5 old documents
- Export multiple documents

**Complexity**: **MEDIUM**
**Need**: Multi-select in document list

#### 4. Document Templates

**Use case**: User frequently creates "Meeting Notes" documents with same structure

**Current**: Start from blank every time

**Possible feature**: Template documents
- Create template with standard first page (title, fields, etc.)
- "New from template" option

**Assessment**: **Nice to have, not critical**

#### 5. Import Existing PDFs

**Current**: Can only create documents via scanning or text pages

**Use case**:
- User has existing PDFs on computer
- Wants to import them into Yiana
- Add more scans to them over time

**Need**: Import PDF → Creates Yiana document

**Complexity**: **LOW**
- Already have code to append PDFs
- Just need import trigger (Files app integration)

**This might be important** for users switching from other systems

#### 6. Page Metadata

**Current**: Pages are just PDF pages, no individual metadata

**Possible uses**:
- Notes on specific pages
- Tags for pages
- "This page is a receipt for $50 at Store X"

**Assessment**: **Out of scope** (adds complexity user wants to avoid)

#### 7. Backup/Restore

**Current**: iCloud sync only

**Questions**:
- What if iCloud fails?
- What if user wants local backup?
- How to restore from backup?

**Options**:
- Export all documents as ZIP
- iTunes file sharing
- Rely on iCloud (simple but risky)

#### 8. Page Rotation

**Use case**: Scan comes in sideways

**Current**: ❌ Can't rotate pages

**Need**: Rotate page 90°/180°/270°

**Complexity**: **LOW**
```swift
page.rotation = (page.rotation + 90) % 360
```

**Assessment**: **Probably needed** - scans often have wrong orientation

---

## The Format Issue 🚨

### Original Plan vs Current Reality

#### Original Design
```
document.yianazip/
├── document.pdf          ← The actual PDF
├── metadata.json         ← Title, dates, tags, etc.
└── ocr_results.json      ← OCR text (optional)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Can unzip and get PDF on any computer
- ✅ Self-contained
- ✅ Easy to understand
- ✅ Future-proof

#### Current Implementation

**File**: `document.yianazip` (NOT actually a ZIP!)

**Format**: Custom binary concatenation
```
[metadata JSON bytes][0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF separator][raw PDF bytes]
```

**How it happened**: From comments in code
> "Package format: `.yianazip` with structure: `[metadata JSON][0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF separator][raw PDF bytes]`"

**Why this is problematic**:
- ❌ Can't open on normal computer (not a real PDF)
- ❌ Can't unzip (not a real ZIP)
- ❌ Defeats original purpose
- ❌ Proprietary format = user lock-in
- ❌ Goes against stated philosophy

### Migration Complexity Assessment

#### Option A: Move to Real ZIP Format

**Structure**:
```
document.yianazip (actual ZIP file)
├── content.pdf
├── metadata.json
└── (other files as needed)
```

**Read/Write**:
```swift
// Writing
let zipURL = tempURL.appendingPathExtension("yianazip")
try ZipArchive.create(at: zipURL) { archive in
    try archive.addFile(pdfData, filename: "content.pdf")
    try archive.addFile(metadataJSON, filename: "metadata.json")
}

// Reading
let archive = try ZipArchive.open(zipURL)
let pdfData = try archive.extract("content.pdf")
let metadataJSON = try archive.extract("metadata.json")
```

**Apple native**: Use `Compression` framework or `ZipFoundation` library

**Complexity**: **MEDIUM**
- ✅ Apple has native ZIP support (Compression framework)
- ⚠️ Need to refactor NoteDocument read/write
- ⚠️ Need migration for existing documents
- ⚠️ iCloud sync needs testing (package vs file)

**Migration path**:
1. Detect old format (look for 0xFF separator)
2. Convert on first open
3. Save in new format
4. Keep old file as backup

**Timeline**: 2-3 days work

#### Option B: Use Document Packages (.yianapkg directory)

**Structure**:
```
document.yianapkg/  (directory that looks like file)
├── content.pdf
├── metadata.json
└── ocr_results.json
```

**iOS supports this**: Like `.app` bundles

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No ZIP overhead
- ✅ Can access files directly
- ✅ Spotlight can index inside
- ✅ Native iOS pattern

**Drawbacks**:
- ⚠️ Not a single file (can't easily email)
- ⚠️ iCloud syncs directory (more complex)
- ❌ Can't open on computer as easily (shows as folder)

**Complexity**: **MEDIUM**
- Similar to ZIP refactor
- UIDocument supports packages natively
- Might be cleaner implementation

#### Option C: Hybrid - Internal ZIP, External Rename

**Current file**: `document.yianazip` (custom format)

**New approach**:
- Internally: Real ZIP file
- Externally: Rename to `.yianazip.zip` or keep `.yianazip`
- User can change extension to `.zip` if needed

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Real ZIP format
- ✅ Can be opened if user renames
- ⚠️ Still has extension confusion

#### Option D: Keep Current Format, Add Export

**Keep**: Current concatenated format for performance

**Add**: "Export as PDF" and "Export document package" options

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No refactor needed
- ✅ Fast read/write
- ⚠️ Still proprietary internal format

**Drawbacks**:
- ❌ Doesn't solve "open on computer" problem
- ❌ User must manually export

### Recommendation: Move to Real ZIP

**Reasoning**:
1. **Matches original intent** - User wanted standard format
2. **Not too complex** - 2-3 days work
3. **Better for users** - Can access data without app
4. **Future-proof** - Standard format survives app changes

**Do this before App Store** to avoid breaking existing users later

**Ship in**: 2-3 weeks after v1.0

---

## Format Migration - Detailed Plan

### Current Format

```swift
// Writing
let metadata = try JSONEncoder().encode(documentMetadata)
let separator = Data([0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF])
let combined = metadata + separator + pdfData
try combined.write(to: fileURL)

// Reading
let combined = try Data(contentsOf: fileURL)
// Find separator...
// Split into metadata and PDF
```

### New Format (ZIP)

```swift
// Writing
import Compression

let zipURL = fileURL
let zipArchive = ArchiveCreator(url: zipURL)
try zipArchive.addFile(data: pdfData, filename: "content.pdf")
try zipArchive.addFile(data: metadataJSON, filename: "metadata.json")
try zipArchive.finalize()

// Reading
let zipArchive = try ArchiveReader(url: zipURL)
let pdfData = try zipArchive.extractFile(named: "content.pdf")
let metadataJSON = try zipArchive.extractFile(named: "metadata.json")
```

### Migration Strategy

```swift
enum DocumentFormat {
    case legacy  // Current concatenated format
    case zip     // New ZIP format

    static func detect(url: URL) -> DocumentFormat {
        // Try to read as ZIP first
        if let _ = try? ZipArchive(url: url, accessMode: .read) {
            return .zip
        }
        // Fall back to legacy
        return .legacy
    }
}

func open(url: URL) {
    let format = DocumentFormat.detect(url: url)

    switch format {
    case .legacy:
        // Read old format
        let (metadata, pdfData) = try readLegacyFormat(url)

        // Schedule migration
        scheduleMigration(url: url, metadata: metadata, pdfData: pdfData)

    case .zip:
        // Read new format
        let (metadata, pdfData) = try readZipFormat(url)
    }
}

func scheduleMigration(url: URL, metadata: Metadata, pdfData: Data) {
    // Convert to ZIP on next save
    needsMigration = true
}
```

**User experience**:
- No action required
- Opens documents as normal
- Saves in new format automatically
- Old format still readable (for safety)

### Testing Migration

1. Create test documents in old format
2. Open in new version
3. Verify read correctly
4. Save (should auto-migrate)
5. Verify new format
6. Verify old version can't accidentally overwrite

---

## The OCR Service Question

**Current**: Mac mini backend service for OCR

**Questions**:
1. Is this required for basic functionality? **No** - app works without OCR
2. Should you document this for users? **Yes** - explain it's optional
3. Alternative: Use on-device Vision framework? **Maybe** - simpler for users

**On-device OCR pros/cons**:
- ✅ Works without server
- ✅ Simpler setup
- ❌ Slower (runs on device)
- ❌ Uses device battery
- ⚠️ Different quality from backend

**Recommendation**:
- Keep Mac mini service for your use
- Add on-device OCR as fallback/option
- Let user choose in settings

---

## Questions to Answer Before Launch

### 1. Target Audience Size

**Is this niche big enough for App Store?**
- People who scan many documents
- Want simplicity over features
- Need iOS/iPad app

**Consider**: Might be small audience, but that's okay if it solves real problem

### 2. Pricing Strategy

**Options**:
- Free with limits (e.g., 10 documents)
- One-time purchase ($2.99 - $9.99)
- Subscription (not recommended for this app)
- Free (rely on tips/donations)

**Recommendation**: One-time purchase, $4.99
- Reasonable for utility app
- No ongoing costs for you
- Clear value proposition

### 3. Support Plan

**Who handles support?**
- Email support?
- GitHub issues?
- FAQ page?

**Recommendation**:
- GitHub issues for technical users
- Email for others
- Comprehensive FAQ

### 4. Update Cadence

**How often will you update?**
- Bug fixes: As needed
- Features: Quarterly?
- iOS updates: Follow Apple releases

---

## Final Recommendations

### Must Do Before Release

1. ✅ **Fix page reorder bug** (data loss)
2. ✅ **Implement page rotation** (90° increments)
3. ✅ **Migrate to ZIP format** (original plan)
4. ✅ **Add PDF import** (existing files)
5. ✅ **Basic tags UI** (organization for "many files")

**Total time**: ~2 weeks full-time

### Consider Doing

6. Copy page between documents (user requested)
7. Export document bundle option
8. App icon and polish

### Can Wait

- Batch operations
- Document templates
- Advanced features

### The Format Decision is Critical

**Strong recommendation**: Do ZIP migration before launch
- Aligns with original vision
- Prevents user lock-in
- Makes data portable
- Only 2-3 days work
- Harder to change later (breaking existing users)

---

## Summary

**Current state**: ~80% ready for basic release

**Critical gaps**:
1. Page reorder bug (data loss - must fix)
2. Format issue (violates original plan - should fix)
3. Page rotation (common need - should add)
4. Import PDFs (adoption barrier - should add)

**Time to MVP**: 2 weeks focused work

**Recommendation**: Fix format issue now, ship v1.0, iterate based on feedback

The app has a clear purpose and mostly achieves it. The format fix is important for your stated goals. Everything else is iterative improvement.
