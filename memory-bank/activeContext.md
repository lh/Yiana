# Active Context

## Current State
- ✅ Xcode project created with multiplatform support
- ✅ Git repository initialized and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ Memory-bank structure created
- ⚠️ Project currently uses Core Data (needs to be replaced with UIDocument)

## What We're Doing Now
Setting up the project structure according to the "brilliant amnesiac expert" methodology:
1. Creating memory-bank files for context persistence
2. Preparing to generate PLAN.md with TDD-driven implementation steps
3. Will replace Core Data with UIDocument architecture

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Complete memory-bank setup
2. Generate comprehensive PLAN.md
3. Start implementing UIDocument architecture with failing tests first

## Important Context
- The app is called "Yiana" (Yiana is another notes app)
- Focus on document scanning and PDF management
- Mac mini will handle OCR processing (not on-device)
- Must maintain iOS/iPadOS/macOS compatibility
