# Ideas & Future Enhancements

## Scanning Improvements
- **Black & White Default Scanning**: Add ability to switch the scanning mode on iPhone/iPad to default to black and white document scanning with colour scan as an option, rather than the current default which is colour. This would:
  - Save storage space (B&W PDFs are smaller)
  - Improve OCR accuracy for text documents
  - Speed up processing
  - Still allow colour when needed (receipts, photos in documents)
  - Implementation: Configure VNDocumentCameraViewController with appropriate settings

## Other Ideas
- Smart tagging based on document content
- Batch operations for multiple documents
- Quick actions from document list (swipe to scan similar, duplicate, etc.)
- Document templates for common types
- Export to various formats beyond PDF
- Integration with other note-taking apps
- Automatic document categorization using ML
