# Yiana

**Simple, private document scanning for iOS and macOS.**

Yiana helps you scan, organise, and search your documents — all synced securely through your personal iCloud account. [Why we built it →](/Yiana/about/)

## Features

### One-Tap Scanning
Two dedicated buttons for the scans you need:
- **Monochrome** — Perfect for text documents, forms, and receipts. Clean, sharp, smaller files.
- **Colour** — For photos, diagrams, or anything where colour matters.

Yiana automatically detects page edges and enhances quality. No fiddling with settings.

### Text Notes
Create text documents directly in Yiana. Write notes, draft letters, or compose any text content. When you're done, your note is saved as a PDF — creating a permanent, tamper-evident record just like your scans.

### Add Text to Pages
Need to fill in a form? Add text directly onto any page with precise positioning controls. Nudge text pixel-by-pixel to line up exactly where you need it — perfect for forms, annotations, or adding notes to existing documents.

### Import PDFs
Already have PDF files? Import them directly into Yiana to keep all your documents in one place.

### Organise with Folders
Create folders to organise your documents however you like. Keep work separate from personal, or organise by project, client, or date.

### Search Your Documents
Find any document instantly. Yiana processes your scanned documents so you can search through their text content.

### iCloud Sync
Your documents sync automatically across all your Apple devices. Start a scan on your iPhone, continue on your iPad, review on your Mac.

### Privacy First
Your documents stay yours. Everything is stored in your personal iCloud account — we never see your data.

### No Vendor Lock-In
Your documents are stored as standard ZIP files containing PDFs. Extract them anytime, with or without Yiana. [Learn more →](/Yiana/your-data/)
