# Yiana

**Simple, private document scanning for iOS and macOS.**

Yiana helps you scan, organise, and search your documents — all synced securely through your personal iCloud account.

## Features

### Scan Documents
Use your iPhone or iPad camera to capture documents. Yiana automatically detects page edges and enhances image quality for clear, readable scans.

### Import PDFs
Already have PDF files? Import them directly into Yiana to keep all your documents in one place.

### Organise with Folders
Create folders to organise your documents however you like. Keep work separate from personal, or organise by project, client, or date.

### Search Your Documents
Find any document instantly. Yiana processes your scanned documents so you can search through their text content.

### iCloud Sync
Your documents sync automatically across all your Apple devices. Start a scan on your iPhone, continue on your iPad, review on your Mac.

### Privacy First
Your documents stay yours. Everything is stored in your personal iCloud account — we never see your data.
