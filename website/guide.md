Welcome to Yiana! This guide will help you get started with scanning and organising your documents.

## First Launch

When you first open Yiana, you'll see a welcome document that explains the basics. Feel free to delete it once you've read it.

## Scanning Documents

Yiana offers two scanning modes, each with a dedicated button:

### Monochrome Scanning

Best for text documents, forms, receipts, and anything primarily black and white.

1. Tap the **+** button
2. Choose **Scan Mono**
3. Position your camera over the document
4. Yiana will automatically detect the page edges
5. Tap the shutter button or wait for auto-capture
6. Add more pages or tap **Save** when done

Monochrome scans are optimised for readability and produce smaller file sizes.

### Colour Scanning

Best for photos, diagrams, colour charts, or any document where colour matters.

1. Tap the **+** button
2. Choose **Scan Colour**
3. Follow the same process as monochrome

**Scanning Tips:**
- Use good, even lighting for best results
- Keep the camera steady
- Yiana automatically enhances contrast and sharpness
- The app works best with documents on a contrasting background

## Creating Text Notes

Create text documents directly in Yiana — perfect for notes, letters, or any text content.

1. Tap the **+** button
2. Choose **New Text Note**
3. Type your content
4. When finished, navigate away from the note

**Important:** When you exit a text note, it's automatically saved as a PDF. This creates a permanent, tamper-evident record — just like your scans. The text becomes part of the PDF and cannot be edited afterwards.

This is by design: Yiana treats all documents as permanent records, whether scanned or typed.

## Adding Text to Pages

Need to fill in a form or add annotations? Yiana lets you add text directly onto any page with precise positioning.

1. Open a document
2. Navigate to the page you want to annotate
3. Tap the **Add Text** button
4. Tap where you want to place text
5. Type your text
6. Use the **positioning controls** to adjust placement:
   - Drag to move roughly
   - Use arrow buttons to nudge pixel-by-pixel
   - Perfect for lining up text on form fields

**Tips for form filling:**
- Zoom in for precise placement
- Use the fine-adjustment controls to align text exactly with form fields
- Preview your changes before saving

## Importing PDFs

Already have PDF files? Import them into Yiana:

1. Tap the **+** button
2. Choose **Import**
3. Select your PDF file
4. The document will be added to your library

You can also share PDFs from other apps directly to Yiana using the Share sheet.

## Organising with Folders

Keep your documents organised:

1. Long-press in the document list
2. Choose **New Folder**
3. Name your folder
4. Drag documents into folders, or move them using the context menu

## Searching Documents

Once your documents are processed, you can search through their content:

1. Tap the **Search** field
2. Type your search term
3. Results show matching documents with highlighted text
4. Tap a result to jump directly to the matching page

**Note:** Scanned documents need to be processed before text search works. This happens automatically if you have the OCR backend configured, or when using the optional processing service.

## iCloud Sync

Your documents sync automatically via iCloud:

- Documents appear on all your Apple devices signed into the same iCloud account
- Changes sync in the background
- No setup required — it just works

**Note:** Make sure iCloud Drive is enabled in your device settings.

## Viewing Documents

- **Swipe** left and right to navigate pages
- **Pinch** to zoom in and out
- **Double-tap** to fit the page to the screen
- Use the **page thumbnails** in the sidebar for quick navigation

## Tips & Tricks

- **Swipe left** on a document to delete it
- **Long-press** a document for more options
- On iPad, use the sidebar to switch between pages and other views
- On Mac, use keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation
- Your documents are always accessible as standard PDFs — see [Your Data](/your-data/)
