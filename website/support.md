## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where are my documents stored?

Your documents are stored in your personal iCloud Drive account, in a folder managed by Yiana. We don't have access to your documents — they're entirely yours.

### How do I sync documents between devices?

Syncing happens automatically via iCloud. Just make sure:
- You're signed into the same Apple ID on all devices
- iCloud Drive is enabled in Settings
- Yiana has permission to use iCloud

### Can I access my documents outside of Yiana?

Yes! Your documents are stored in iCloud Drive. You can find them in the Files app under iCloud Drive → Yiana.

### How do I search for text in my documents?

Documents are automatically processed for text search. Simply use the search bar at the top of the document list. Search results will show matching documents and highlight the matching text.

### Why can't I search a document I just scanned?

Document processing happens in the background. It may take a few moments for newly scanned documents to become searchable.

### How do I delete a document?

Swipe left on any document in the list and tap Delete. You can also long-press a document and choose Delete from the menu.

### Can I recover a deleted document?

Deleted documents go to your iCloud Drive's Recently Deleted folder. You can recover them from there within 30 days.

### Does Yiana work offline?

Yes! You can scan and view documents offline. They'll sync to iCloud when you're back online.
