# Your Documents Are Always Yours

Yiana is designed with **no vendor lock-in**. Your documents are stored in a simple, open format that you can access anytime — with or without Yiana.

## The .yianazip Format

Yiana documents use the `.yianazip` format. Despite the custom extension, it's just a **standard ZIP file** containing:

```
document.yianazip
├── content.pdf      ← Your actual PDF
└── metadata.json    ← Title, dates, tags (plain text)
```

## How to Extract Your PDF

If you ever need to access your documents outside of Yiana, it takes just a few seconds:

### On Mac

1. Find your document in **Finder** (iCloud Drive → Yiana)
2. **Right-click** the `.yianazip` file
3. Select **Rename** and change the extension from `.yianazip` to `.zip`
4. **Double-click** the `.zip` file to extract
5. Open the folder and find your **`content.pdf`**

### On iPhone/iPad

1. Open the **Files** app
2. Navigate to iCloud Drive → Yiana
3. **Long-press** the `.yianazip` file
4. Tap **Rename** and change `.yianazip` to `.zip`
5. Tap the `.zip` file to extract
6. Open the extracted folder to find **`content.pdf`**

### On Windows

1. Find your document in File Explorer (iCloud Drive → Yiana)
2. **Right-click** the `.yianazip` file
3. Select **Rename** and change the extension to `.zip`
4. **Right-click** the `.zip` file and select **Extract All**
5. Find your **`content.pdf`** in the extracted folder

## Where Are My Documents Stored?

All your documents are stored in your personal iCloud Drive:

```
iCloud Drive
└── Yiana
    ├── Document 1.yianazip
    ├── Document 2.yianazip
    └── My Folder
        └── Document 3.yianazip
```

You can browse this folder anytime using the Files app (iOS/iPadOS) or Finder (Mac).

## Bulk Export

Yiana also includes a bulk export feature (Mac only) that lets you export all your documents as standard PDFs at once:

1. Open Yiana on your Mac
2. Go to **File → Export All Documents as PDFs**
3. Choose a destination folder
4. All documents will be exported as regular PDF files

## Our Promise

- **No lock-in** — Your PDFs are always accessible
- **Standard formats** — ZIP and PDF, nothing proprietary
- **Your iCloud** — We never have access to your files
- **Export anytime** — Bulk export to standard PDFs whenever you want

We believe your documents belong to you, and you should never be trapped by the software you use.
