**Welcome to Yiana!** This 2-minute tutorial will teach you everything you need to know to get started.

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll:
- Create and scan your first document
- Add a text page with notes
- Search across all your documents
- Use gestures to navigate efficiently

**Time needed**: About 2 minutes

## Step 1: Create and Scan Your First Document (60 seconds)

Yiana uses your device's camera to scan documents into high-quality PDFs.

### Create a Document

1. **Tap the "+" button** in the top right
2. **Select "New Document"**
3. **Enter a descriptive title** (e.g., "Receipt - Coffee Shop Feb 2026")
   - You must provide a title before the document can be created
4. **Tap "Create"**

The new document opens automatically, ready for scanning.

### Scan Pages

1. **Tap either scan button** at the bottom:
   - **"Scan"** (colorful circle) - for color documents
   - **"Doc"** (gray circle) - for black and white text documents
2. **Point your camera** at a document (receipt, letter, form, etc.)
3. **Camera automatically detects and captures** - no shutter button needed
   - Auto-detects edges and crops
   - Auto-enhances contrast and sharpness
   - Corrects perspective
4. **Review the scan** and tap "Save" or "Retake"
5. **Scan more pages** by tapping the scan button again

> **Automatic Scanning**: Yiana uses Apple's VisionKit which automatically detects documents and captures them - you don't need to manually press a shutter button.

> **Color vs B&W**: Use "Doc" (gray circle) for receipts and text documents. Use "Scan" (colorful circle) for photos, forms, or anything with color.

Your first document is now saved in Yiana. On-device OCR runs automatically, making the text searchable within seconds.

## Step 2: Add a Text Page (45 seconds)

Text pages let you add typed notes that become part of your document.

### How to Create a Text Page

1. **Tap the "Text" button** (bottom right, with document icon)
2. A markdown editor will open - **type your notes**
   - Example: "Expense for business lunch - $42.50"
   - Example: "Deductible for tax filing"
3. **Use the toolbar** to format your text:
   - **Bold** - Tap the **B** icon
   - *Italic* - Tap the *I* icon
   - Headers - Tap "Heading" and choose level 1, 2, or 3
   - Lists - Tap the bullet or numbered list icon
   - Dividers - Tap the horizontal line icon
4. **Tap "Done"** when finished

> **How it works**: Text pages are rendered to PDF when you exit the note. They become permanent pages in your document - just like pen and paper.

> **Preview mode**: On iPad, you'll see a live preview of your text as you type. On iPhone, tap "Preview" to see how it will look.

Your document now has both scanned pages and typed notes.

## Step 3: Search Your Documents (30 seconds)

Yiana's search finds text in both scanned documents (via OCR) and text pages, powered by a full-text search index.

### How to Search

1. **Tap the back arrow** to return to your document list
2. **Tap the search bar** at the top
3. **Type what you're looking for**
   - Example: "coffee"
   - Example: "expense"
   - Example: "2026"
4. **Tap a search result** to jump directly to that page

> **Smart search**: Yiana searches document titles, scanned text (OCR), and text pages. Results show snippets with your search term highlighted. Stemming means "running" also matches "run".

> **Search tips**:
> - Search is case-insensitive
> - Matches appear in both titles and content
> - On-device OCR makes scans searchable within seconds

## Step 4: Navigate with Gestures (30 seconds)

Yiana uses intuitive gestures for quick navigation.

### Essential Gestures

**While viewing a document**:

- **Swipe left/right** - Navigate between pages
- **Swipe up** - View all pages in a thumbnail grid
- **Pinch to zoom** - Zoom in/out on PDF pages
- **Double-tap** - Fit page to screen

**In the page grid** (after swiping up):
- **Tap a page** - Jump to that page
- **Long press** - Select page for deletion or reordering
- **Drag pages** - Reorder pages in your document

> **Gesture tip**: Swipe-up only works when pages are at normal zoom level (not zoomed in).

## Organizing Your Documents (Optional)

As you add more documents, keep them organized with folders.

### Creating Folders

1. **Tap the "+" button** in the top-right corner
2. **Select "New Folder"**
3. **Name your folder**
   - Examples: "Receipts", "Medical", "Work", "Tax 2025"
4. **Tap inside the folder** to add documents

### Moving Documents

1. **Long press** on a document
2. **Select "Move"**
3. **Choose the destination folder**

> **Folder tip**: Use a mix of folders and search. Folders for broad categories, search for specific items. You can also rename folders by right-clicking (macOS) or long pressing (iOS).
