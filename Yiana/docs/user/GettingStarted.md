## What You'll Learn

- ✅ Use gestures to navigate efficiently

**Time needed**: About 2 minutes

## Step 1: Create and Scan Your First Document (60 seconds)

Yiana uses your device's camera to scan documents into high-quality PDFs.

### Create a Document

1. **Tap the "+" button** in the top right
2. **Select "New Document"**
3. **Enter a descriptive title** (e.g., "Receipt - Coffee Shop Oct 2025")
   - You must provide a title before the document can be created
4. **Tap "Create"**

The new document opens automatically, ready for scanning.

### Scan Pages

1. **Tap either scan button** at the bottom:
   - **"Scan"** (colorful circle) - for color documents
   - **"Doc"** (gray circle) - for black & white text documents
2. **Point your camera** at a document (receipt, letter, form, etc.)
3. **Camera automatically detects and captures** - no shutter button needed!
   - Auto-detects edges and crops
   - Auto-enhances contrast and sharpness
   - Corrects perspective
4. **Review the scan** and tap "Save" or "Retake"
5. **Scan more pages** by tapping the scan button again

> 📸 **Automatic Scanning**: Yiana uses Apple's VisionKit which automatically detects documents and captures them - you don't need to manually press a shutter button.

> 🎨 **Color vs B&W**: Use "Doc" (gray circle) for receipts and text documents. Use "Scan" (colorful circle) for photos, forms, or anything with color.

✅ **You did it!** Your first document is now saved in Yiana.

## Step 2: Add a Text Page (45 seconds)

Text pages let you add typed notes that become part of your document.

### How to Create a Text Page

1. **Tap the "Text" button** (bottom right, with document icon)
2. A markdown editor will open - **type your notes**
   - Example: "Expense for business lunch - $42.50"
   - Example: "Deductible for tax filing"
3. **Use the toolbar** to format your text:
   - **Bold** - Tap the **B** icon
   - *Italic* - Tap the *I* icon
   - Headers - Tap "Heading" and choose level 1, 2, or 3
   - Lists - Tap the bullet or numbered list icon
   - Dividers - Tap the horizontal line icon
4. **Tap "Done"** when finished

> 📝 **How it works**: Text pages are rendered to PDF when you exit the note. They become permanent pages in your document - just like pen and paper!

> 🔄 **Preview mode**: On iPad, you'll see a live preview of your text as you type. On iPhone, tap "Preview" to see how it will look.

✅ **Your document now has both scanned pages and typed notes!**

## Step 3: Search Your Documents (30 seconds)

Yiana's powerful search finds text in both scanned documents (via OCR) and text pages.

### How to Search

1. **Tap the back arrow** to return to your document list
2. **Tap the search bar** at the top
3. **Type what you're looking for**
   - Example: "coffee"
   - Example: "expense"
   - Example: "2025"
4. **Tap a search result** to jump directly to that page

> 🔍 **Smart search**: Yiana searches document titles, scanned text (OCR), and text pages. Results show snippets with your search term highlighted.

> 🏷️ **Search tips**:
> - Search is case-insensitive
> - Matches appear in both titles and content
> - Blue icon = found in title
> - Magnifying glass icon = found in scanned text

## Step 4: Navigate with Gestures (30 seconds)

Yiana uses intuitive gestures for quick navigation.
