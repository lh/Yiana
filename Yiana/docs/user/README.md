## Privacy and Philosophy

### Privacy First

- **Your data stays yours** - Local and iCloud only
- **No tracking** - Zero analytics or telemetry
- **No ads** - Clean, focused experience
- **Encrypted** - End-to-end security

### Pen and Paper Philosophy

Yiana is designed to feel like physical documents:

- **Text pages are permanent** - Once written, they can't be edited (just like pen on paper)
- **Simple organization** - Folders and titles, no complex tagging systems
- **Read-only PDFs** - View documents without heavy annotation overhead
- **One document, one place** - Clear, simple organization

### LEGO Approach

We use proven Apple frameworks:
- **VisionKit** for scanning
- **Vision** for on-device OCR
- **PDFKit** for viewing
- **iCloud** for sync
- **GRDB** for search indexing
- **No reinventing the wheel**

This means:
- Faster performance
- Better reliability
- Familiar iOS/macOS behavior
- Smaller app size

## Quick Tips

**Use descriptive titles** - Include dates, vendors, amounts for easy searching

**Scan immediately** - Don't let receipts pile up, scan when you get them

**Search often** - Faster than browsing folders

**Text pages for notes** - Add context to scanned documents

**Folders for categories** - Create folders like "Tax 2025", "Medical", "Receipts"

**Export for sharing** - Share clean PDFs without metadata

**Double-tap to fit** - Reset zoom before using swipe-up gesture
