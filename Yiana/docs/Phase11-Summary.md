### Key Technical Decisions:
- Always append scanned pages (user preference)
- Real folders, not virtual tags
- Simple two-section search UI
- NoteDocument format: metadata JSON + 0xFFFFFFFF separator + PDF data

### Known Issues:
- Bash tool having issues after extended sessions (infrastructure problem, not project-related)

### Next Steps:
- **TEST PHASE 11 FIRST!** - Test page management functionality on both iOS and macOS
- **Phase 12**: Mac Mini OCR Server (after testing)
- **Phase 13**: Export Functionality

### Important Files Created/Modified in Phase 11:
- `/Users/rose/Code/Yiana/Yiana/Yiana/Views/PageManagementView.swift` (new)
- `/Users/rose/Code/Yiana/Yiana/Yiana/Views/DocumentEditView.swift` (modified - added page management button)
- `/Users/rose/Code/Yiana/Yiana/Yiana/Views/DocumentReadView.swift` (modified - added page management button)

### Testing Commands (when bash works):
```bash
# iOS build
xcodebuild -scheme Yiana -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' -configuration Debug CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO

# macOS build  
xcodebuild -scheme Yiana -destination 'platform=macOS' -configuration Debug CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO
```

### User Preferences:
- Simplicity over features
- Follow phases in order
- Always append pages when scanning
- Real folders for organization

Last user message: "lets keep going in order" (after Phase 10 completion)

## IMPORTANT REMINDER:
**When restarting, TEST PHASE 11 FIRST before proceeding to Phase 12!**

### What to Test in Phase 11:
1. Open a document with multiple pages
2. Tap/click the "Pages" button (circle with rectangle.stack icon)
3. Verify thumbnail grid appears
4. Test selecting pages in edit mode
5. Test deleting selected pages
6. Test drag-to-reorder on iOS
7. Verify changes save correctly
8. Test on both iOS and macOS platforms
