# ZIP Refactor â€“ Phase 1 Test Attempts
**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Branch**: refactor/zip

## Commands Executed
1. `swift test` (package: `YianaDocumentArchive`)
2. `swift test` (package: `YianaOCRService`)

## Result
Both commands failed to launch because the sandbox blocked access to SwiftPM caches (`/Users/rose/.cache/clang/ModuleCache`). No unit tests were executed. Please rerun locally outside the sandbox once convenient.

```
error: 'yianadocumentarchive': Invalid manifest ...
<unknown>:0: error: error opening '/Users/rose/.cache/clang/ModuleCache/Swift-207X6UTF85MUY.swiftmodule' for output: ... Operation not permitted
```

Same error occurred for `YianaOCRService` after adding the shared archive dependency.

## Next Steps
- Re-run unit tests locally (Xcode or swift test) once sandbox restrictions are lifted.
- Capture new logs in `test-results/` after successful execution.
