# Test Results Directory

This directory tracks test execution results during the ZIP format refactor.

## Structure

- `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-test-run.md` - Individual test run reports
- `test-status.md` - Current status of all tests
- `baseline.md` - Baseline test results before refactor starts

## Test Run Report Format

Each test run report includes:
- Date and time
- Git branch and commit
- Test files executed
- Results (pass/fail/skip)
- Error messages and logs
- Duration

## Test Status Tracking

The `test-status.md` file tracks:
- Which tests are passing
- Which tests are failing
- Which tests are blocked by dependencies
- Expected vs actual state
